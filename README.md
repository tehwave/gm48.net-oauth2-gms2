# gm48.net OAuth2 for GameMaker Studio 2

Utilize official gm48.net OAuth2 account authentication in GameMaker Studio 2

## Requirements

* YYC (YoYo Compiler)
* GameMaker Studio 2 v2.3.0 or newer
* Windows (other platforms not supported, but may work)
* Client credentials provided from [gm48.net](https://gm48.net)

## Installation

1) Copy and paste the contents of the [gm48_oauth2_library.gml](scripts/gm48_oauth2_library/gm48_oauth2_library.gml) file into a new script resource.

2) Create a new persistent object resource and set up the following events:

**Create**

```gml
gm48_oauth2_init("CLIENT ID", "CLIENT SECRET");
```

The `CLIENT ID` and and `CLIENT SECRET` values must be replaced with your credentials.

These values are made available to you when you create the first leaderboard for your game.

You may create the leaderboard via gm48.net Dashboard > Games > (your game) > Leaderboards.

**Step**
```gml
gm48_oauth2_keepalive();
```

**Async HTTP**

```gml
gm48_oauth2_http();
```

**Async Networking**

```gml
gm48_oauth2_networking();
```

### Example project

Download the repository and open the project file in GameMaker Studio 2.

The project will not work out-of-the-box, as the Client ID and Secret credentials provided are not real.

### Why is YYC (YoYo Compiler) required?

You should export your game using YYC (YoYo Compiler) to avoid involuntary disclosure of sensitive information from your game.

Games compiled without using the YYC may be reverse-engineered. That would make it possible to extract the sensitive Client ID and Secret credentials from your game.

As games can't be updated past the game jam's deadline, once the sensitive information has been made public, action will be taken to prevent any further access to the gm48.net API via your game.

You should therefore ensure that your game takes loss of connection to the gm48.net API into account, and provide any necessary error handling as such.

Note that nothing in the gm48.net API allows sensitive or personal user account information to be retrieved or updated.

## Usage

Ask the player for authorization to use their gm48.net account.

```gml
gm48_oauth2_authorize(callback);
```

You must provide a script resource to execute when the authorization has finished.

See the [`scr_callback_example`](scripts/scr_callback_example/scr_callback_example.gml) script resource provided.

Once successfully authorized, you now have an Access token stored in the ```gm48_oauth2_access_token``` global variable.

You must use the token for authentication to the gm48.net API. The official libraries takes care of this part for you.

### Retrieving information about the authenticated user

The authenticated user information is available via an GET request to `https://gm48.net/api/v4/user/me`.

This library does not currently have any functionality out-of-the-box to help you retrieve this information.

That's on the üìù TODO list.

### Scores & Leaderboards

Please refer to the [gm48.net Leaderboards for GameMaker Studio 2 repository](https://github.com/tehwave/gm48.net-leaderboards-gms2) for implementation.
